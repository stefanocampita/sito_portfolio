      <!-- ARTICLE BODY -->
      <article class="card article-content">

        <p>This weekly recap covers the period from <strong>8 to 14 December 2025</strong>. The key message is that
          <strong>policy became supportive on paper</strong> (the Fed cut rates), yet
          <strong>the AI/mega-cap leadership trade wobbled</strong> as investors started asking a harder question:
          <em>when do the massive AI spending plans turn into reliable returns?</em>
        </p>

        <p>For finance students, this week is a clean case study in a very modern dynamic:
          <strong>even when the “macro headline” looks dovish, equity leadership can still crack</strong> if valuations
          are stretched and the market starts debating the quality of forward guidance, margins, and capex discipline.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fed cut rates</strong> on Dec 10 and delivered an official statement framing growth/inflation and risks.</li>
          <li><strong>Oracle</strong> sold off sharply after results/guidance and heavy spending raised “ROI” questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Broadcom’s outlook</strong> added fuel to “AI bubble” chatter, amplifying tech weakness.</li>
          <li><strong>U.S. Treasury yields jumped</strong> late week, pressuring high-duration stocks.</li>
          <li><strong>Rotation showed up</strong>: even as tech stumbled, other sectors held up better.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. The Hard Facts: What Actually Happened</h2>

        <h3>1.1 The Fed: a rate cut, officially</h3>
        <p>On <strong>December 10, 2025</strong>, the Federal Reserve released the official FOMC statement announcing its decision
          and describing the economic backdrop (growth, labor conditions, inflation, and risks). This matters because it anchors
          the week’s macro interpretation: any “soft landing” talk or discount-rate narrative should start from the Fed’s primary-source language,
          not commentary.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Official FOMC statement (Dec 10, 2025): Federal Reserve press release page.</li>
          <li>Fed meeting page (Dec 10, 2025): links to statement, projections, transcript, minutes release schedule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Tech shock: Oracle’s guidance + spending triggered a rethink</h3>
        <p>Midweek, <strong>Oracle</strong> became a focal point for the market’s AI skepticism.
          Reuters reported that Oracle’s forecasts and large spending plans fanned doubts about how quickly big AI bets will pay off,
          and the stock’s decline contributed to a broader tech wobble.</p>

        <h3>1.3 The “one-two punch”: Broadcom + Oracle fed “AI bubble” angst</h3>
        <p>Late week, Reuters described a key setup: Broadcom’s outlook rekindled “AI bubble” fears and contributed to declines in the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq,
          while investors appeared to rotate away from high-growth AI names into more value-leaning areas. Reuters also highlighted that
          some consumer names moved strongly (e.g., Lululemon jumping after raised forecasts), illustrating how
          <strong>stock-level stories can dominate even in a “macro week.”</strong></p>

        <h3>1.4 Rates matter (again): yields jumped, duration got punished</h3>
        <p>Reuters and AP both noted that rising Treasury yields added pressure to high-priced/high-duration stocks as tech fell late week.
          AP reported the 10-year yield reaching around <strong>4.18%</strong> on Dec 12 and described how higher yields can reduce appetite for expensive growth stocks.</p>

        <h2>2. Interpretation: What It Means (and Why It Was Not “Just Noise”)</h2>

        <h3>2.1 “Dovish macro” does not guarantee “easy equities”</h3>
        <p>At first glance, a Fed cut looks like an automatic positive for risk assets. But this week showed why that shortcut can fail:
          if the market starts questioning <strong>the quality of earnings and the sustainability of margins</strong> under heavy AI capex,
          the equity risk premium demanded by investors can rise even as policy gets easier.</p>

        <h3>2.2 This was a valuation week disguised as a macro week</h3>
        <p>What made the week educational is that the selling pressure was not evenly distributed.
          Tech and AI-linked names took the brunt, while other sectors were comparatively resilient.
          That’s a classic sign that the market is debating <strong>valuation and capital discipline</strong> rather than reacting to a broad recession shock.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Modeling takeaway: stress-test your “AI optimism” assumptions</h3>
        <p>If you’re building models on AI-exposed names, this week highlights what you must stress-test:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Capex path vs. margin path:</strong> if spending rises faster than operating leverage, near-term EPS can disappoint even as revenue grows.</li>
          <li><strong>Discount-rate sensitivity:</strong> small moves in yields can materially change fair values for long-duration cash flows.</li>
          <li><strong>Terminal value realism:</strong> if a stock is priced for perfection, any guidance ambiguity can compress multiples quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. “Gossip” (Handled Carefully): What the Market Was Talking About</h2>

        <p>This section is intentionally framed as <em>market chatter</em>—not fact. It’s useful because it helps explain positioning and flows.</p>

        <h3>3.1 “AI bubble” talk returned</h3>
        <p>After Oracle’s guidance/spending headlines and Broadcom’s outlook, some traders and commentators argued that parts of the AI trade
          were priced for a smooth, fast payoff—and that the market was starting to demand clearer proof of returns.
          Reuters explicitly described “AI bubble fears” as part of the narrative for the late-week move.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Rotation whispers: “growth fatigue” vs “value resilience”</h3>
        <p>Several market recaps framed the week as a rotation moment: even if indices didn’t collapse, leadership shifted.
          Reuters noted rotation away from high-growth AI names into value sectors such as healthcare.
          In practice, this is the kind of flow dynamic that can persist for weeks once it starts.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Meme-adjacent chatter: cannabis stocks jumped on reports</h3>
        <p>Reuters also noted that cannabis stocks jumped following <em>reports</em> that President Trump may ease marijuana restrictions.
          This is not central to the macro story, but it’s exactly the type of “headline-driven pocket rally” that readers find memorable—
          and a reminder that single-policy headlines can create sharp sector moves even when the broader tape is calm.</p>

        <h2>4. Fixed Income &amp; Credit: Quiet, but Not Irrelevant</h2>
        <p>The bond market’s message during the week was that yields can still move meaningfully even when the macro calendar isn’t packed.
          The practical implication for equity investors is simple: if yields rise, the market becomes less forgiving on valuation,
          and “duration” becomes a performance divider.</p>

        <h2>5. Cross-Asset Snapshot: Dollar/Yields as the Transmission Channel</h2>
        <p>Reuters described the late-week combination of <strong>higher yields</strong> and a <strong>firmer dollar</strong> alongside falling tech shares.
          For students, this is the clean macro-finance linkage:
          <strong>rates + currency conditions shape equity leadership</strong>, especially for global tech and high-multiple growth.</p>

        <h2>6. What To Say in an Interview / Case (IB-friendly)</h2>
        <p>If you need one crisp “desk-style” summary for 8–14 Dec 2025:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Macro:</strong> Fed cut, but the market debated how many cuts really come next.</li>
          <li><strong>Equities:</strong> tech/AI leadership cracked on guidance + spending concerns; rotation under the surface.</li>
          <li><strong>Rates:</strong> yields jumped late week, increasing pressure on long-duration valuations.</li>
          <li><strong>Chatter:</strong> “AI bubble” narratives resurfaced; a few headline sectors (cannabis) popped on reports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Bottom Line: The Week in One Sentence</h2>
        <p><strong>8–14 December 2025</strong> shows a market that can accept a supportive Fed backdrop while still
          punishing crowded, expensive themes when guidance and capex raise doubts about the speed of AI payoffs.</p>
