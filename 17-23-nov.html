    <!-- ARTICLE -->
    <article class="card article-content">

      <p>This third weekly recap covers the period from
        <strong>17 to 23 November 2025</strong>. Unlike the previous week, where
        markets mainly reacted to the political shock of the U.S. shutdown ending,
        this week was dominated by <strong>valuation concerns, volatility, and
        renewed focus on macro momentum</strong>.</p>

      <p>Financial markets showed signs of tension: investors questioned the
        sustainability of high valuations in some sectors, uncertainty around
        monetary policy persisted, and safe-haven assets gained traction.
        For finance students, this is a perfect week to study how sentiment,
        valuation, risk perception, and macro expectations interact.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>market volatility rises again,</li>
        <li>investors reassess AI and tech valuations,</li>
        <li>gold strengthens as uncertainty grows,</li>
        <li>macro data slowly return after shutdown disruption.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1. Macro Environment: Back to Data, But Confidence Still Fragile</h2>

      <p>With the government reopened, attention gradually shifted back toward economic
        fundamentals. Markets began preparing for the return of important delayed data
        releases, including labour and inflation figures.</p>

      <h3>1.1 Growth and confidence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Investors recognised that although the shutdown was over,
          its economic consequences may still appear with delay.</li>
        <li>Growth expectations remained positive but not strong enough
          to eliminate recession concerns.</li>
        <li>Confidence indicators continued reflecting caution from both firms and consumers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In other words, the shutdown resolution removed a tail risk,
        but did not magically restore economic momentum. Markets shifted
        from “political fear” to “economic doubt”.</p>

      <h2>2. Monetary Policy: Expectations Stabilise, Debate Continues</h2>

      <p>Central banks remained a dominant narrative. The main question was not
        <em>whether</em> policy was easing, but <em>how fast</em> and <em>how far</em>
        easing would eventually go.</p>

      <h3>2.1 Market view</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>investors still expected future rate cuts,</li>
        <li>but confidence in aggressive easing remained limited,</li>
        <li>communication from policy makers was cautious and conditional on data.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For valuation logic, this meant that discount rates were not expected
        to spike higher, but neither were they expected to collapse rapidly.
        Markets remained in a “controlled easing” mindset.</p>

      <h2>3. Equities: Choppiness, Rotation, and AI Under Scrutiny</h2>

      <p>The equity market narrative this week revolved around volatility and a
        reassessment of previous winners. Index moves alone do not tell the story;
        the real interest lies in how investors repositioned.</p>

      <h3>3.1 Index dynamics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>U.S. equities experienced swings rather than clean trends,</li>
        <li>global indices behaved unevenly across regions,</li>
        <li>investors adopted a more selective stance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Tech and AI concerns</h3>

      <p>One of the defining elements of this week was
        <strong>greater cautiousness toward high-valuation segments</strong>,
        particularly AI-related technology names.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>valuation multiples were critically examined,</li>
        <li>earnings expectations were questioned,</li>
        <li>positioning became less complacent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is a useful lesson: when an investment theme drives too much of
        the market for too long, investors eventually reassess whether
        fundamentals justify prices.</p>

      <h2>4. Safe Havens & Cross-Asset Signals</h2>

      <p>While equities struggled to find clear direction, cross-asset markets sent
        important signals about risk appetite.</p>

      <h3>4.1 Gold strengthens</h3>
      <p><strong>Gold continued to gain traction</strong>, reflecting investor preference
        for protection against uncertainty.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>hedging demand increased,</li>
        <li>risk-off positioning grew at times,</li>
        <li>concerns around policy, valuations, and growth fed safe-haven interest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Bonds and FX</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>yields fluctuated as markets adjusted rate expectations,</li>
        <li>the U.S. dollar moved with changing risk appetite and policy sentiment,</li>
        <li>rate differentials continued to shape currency trends.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cross-asset consistency matters: when equities wobble, gold strengthens,
        yields move, and FX reacts, you are watching the same story expressed
        through different instruments.</p>

      <h2>5. Global Markets: Not All Regions React the Same</h2>

      <p>Global equity performance remained uneven. Regional fundamentals,
        currency moves, and sector composition dictated relative performance.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>some markets benefited from weaker currencies and better export prospects,</li>
        <li>others lagged due to local economic challenges,</li>
        <li>emerging markets reacted to both global risk tone and domestic stories.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For global allocation, this reinforces the idea that one global
        narrative rarely produces one global outcome.</p>

      <h2>6. Lessons for Finance Students</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Valuation matters</strong> — when prices stretch too far ahead of fundamentals,
          even small doubts can trigger volatility.</li>

        <li><strong>Macro uncertainty does not disappear instantly</strong> — removing political
          risk does not equal economic stability.</li>

        <li><strong>Cross-asset reading is essential</strong> — bonds, gold, FX, and equities
          complement each other in explaining sentiment.</li>

        <li><strong>Market narratives evolve</strong> — AI enthusiasm meets valuation discipline
          is a perfect example of changing investor psychology.</li>

        <li><strong>Weekly context matters</strong> — one week rarely defines the year,
          but it reveals how investors think.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Overall, 17–23 November 2025 can be seen as a transition week:
        markets moved from political relief toward renewed economic questioning,
        while risk appetite became more selective and disciplined.</p>
