    <!-- Intro -->
    <section class="card">
      <p>The discourse surrounding digital assets has changed in recent years. Trading Bitcoin and chasing the newest cryptocurrency trend are no longer the only options. The tokenization of tangible assets is now the main focus, resulting much more structural. Tokenization is not just hype; it is a real change that is making its way into investment banks and private equity boardrooms.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Meaning -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The true meaning of tokenization</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <p>Fundamentally, tokenization is the process of using a digital token on a blockchain to represent a real asset, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or shares of private equity funds.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Advantages -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The advantages are compelling</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Fractional ownership:</strong> expanding access to historically exclusive asset classes and reducing barriers to entry.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased liquidity:</strong> opening previously untraded assets to new opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency and transparency:</strong> enhanced record-keeping, quicker settlements, and automated procedures through smart contracts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Why it matters -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Why does this matter for Investment Banking and Private Equity?</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <p class="small"><strong>Private Equity —</strong> tokenization gives investors more options for investment and exit strategies by opening up secondary markets and introducing new fundraising models.</p>
      <p class="small"><strong>Investment Banking —</strong> blockchain adoption enables faster deal execution, leaner intermediation costs, and exposure to new fintech or crypto-native targets that are becoming strategically relevant.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Examples -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Real-World Examples</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Strong institutional confidence in blockchain as market infrastructure was demonstrated by BlackRock's launch of <em>BUIDL</em>, the largest tokenized fund in the world.</li>
        <li>Both Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are exploring tokenized money-market funds, aiming to accelerate settlements and enhance liquidity.</li>
        <li>Inversion Labs, a startup that applies private equity principles to the cryptocurrency space, is raising a $500 million fund to pursue acquisitions in the industry.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Opportunities & challenges -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Opportunities and challenges</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <p>Access to private markets, which have historically been exclusive to high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, could become more widely available through tokenization. It might change the way money is raised, exchanged, and exited.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Different jurisdictions are moving at different speeds, and regulation is still fragmented and changing.</li>
        <li>From data security to the infrastructure of digital wallets, technology and custody risks continue to be crucial.</li>
        <li>As entry barriers decline and transparency rises, pressure may be placed on private market business models.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
