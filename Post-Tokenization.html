    <!-- Intro -->
    <section class="card">
      <p>The discourse surrounding digital assets has changed in recent years. Trading Bitcoin and chasing the latest cryptocurrency trend are no longer the only focal points. The tokenization of tangible assets is now at the center of attention, representing a far more structural shift. Tokenization is not just hype; it is a real change that is making its way into investment banks and private equity boardrooms.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Meaning -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The true meaning of tokenization</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <p>Fundamentally, tokenization is the process of using a digital token on a blockchain to represent a real asset, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or private equity fund shares.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Advantages -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The advantages are compelling</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Fractional ownership:</strong> expanding access to historically exclusive asset classes and reducing barriers to entry.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased liquidity:</strong> creating opportunities for assets that were previously difficult to trade.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency and transparency:</strong> improved record-keeping, faster settlements, and automated processes through smart contracts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Why it matters -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Why does this matter for Investment Banking and Private Equity?</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <p class="small"><strong>Private Equity —</strong> tokenization provides investors with more options for investment and exit strategies by opening up secondary markets and introducing new fundraising models.</p>
      <p class="small"><strong>Investment Banking —</strong> blockchain adoption enables faster deal execution, leaner intermediation costs, and exposure to new fintech or crypto-native targets that are becoming strategically relevant.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Examples -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Real-World Examples</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>BlackRock's launch of <em>BUIDL</em>, the world’s largest tokenized fund, demonstrated strong institutional confidence in blockchain as market infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are piloting tokenized money-market funds to accelerate settlements and enhance liquidity.</li>
        <li>Inversion Labs, a startup applying private equity principles to the crypto space, is raising a $500 million fund to pursue acquisitions in the industry.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Opportunities & challenges -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Opportunities and challenges</h2>
    <section class="card">
      <p>Access to private markets, historically reserved for institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, could become more widely available through tokenization. It might change the way capital is raised, traded, and exited.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Regulation remains fragmented and evolving, with jurisdictions moving at different speeds.</li>
        <li>Technology and custody risks remain critical, from data security to digital wallet infrastructure.</li>
        <li>As barriers to entry fall and transparency increases, private-market business models may come under pressure.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Key takeaways -->
    <section class="card takeaways">
      <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Tokenization is moving from concept to practice in IB and PE.</li>
        <li>Benefits: fractional access, improved liquidity, faster and more transparent settlement.</li>
