      <article class="card article-content">

        <p>This weekly recap covers the period from <strong>15 to 21 December 2025</strong>. The key message is that
          <strong>inflation data finally landed</strong> (a softer-than-expected November CPI),
          and it gave markets a reason to re-price rate cut odds — but the week’s real “energy” came from
          <strong>single-name catalysts</strong>. In a thin year-end tape, a handful of headlines (AI earnings,
          deal talk, and guidance surprises) drove outsized moves and shaped the narrative more than broad macro did.</p>

        <p>For finance students, this is a classic week to learn the difference between
          <strong>macro direction</strong> (inflation → rates → discount factors) and
          <strong>micro shock</strong> (earnings and deal news → repricing of cash-flow expectations and multiples).</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>November CPI (BLS)</strong> showed inflation running softer than expected, lifting cut expectations.</li>
          <li><strong>Tech rallied</strong> as investors leaned back into duration after inflation relief.</li>
          <li><strong>Micron</strong> delivered a strong AI-linked outlook and became the poster child for “AI is still real.”</li>
          <li><strong>TikTok deal headlines</strong> pushed Oracle back into the spotlight and into “deal chatter” territory.</li>
          <li><strong>Year-end positioning</strong> amplified moves: the market looked calm at the index level, loud at the stock level.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. The Facts: What We Can Anchor to Data and Primary Sources</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Inflation: CPI (November 2025) finally arrives</h3>
        <p>On <strong>December 18, 2025</strong>, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published the official CPI release for
          <strong>November 2025</strong>. Reuters described the report as showing consumer prices rising
          <strong>less than expected</strong> and noted that it nudged up expectations for an early-2026 rate cut.
          Reuters also flagged that the report was affected by the extended government shutdown, which disrupted data collection
          (including the absence of an October CPI update).</p>

        <p>For modeling, CPI matters because it feeds directly into
          <strong>real rate assumptions, discount rates, margins (via input costs), and consumer purchasing power</strong>.
          Even small changes in the perceived inflation path can change equity duration leadership.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Market reaction: risk assets “liked” the inflation surprise</h3>
        <p>Reuters reported that U.S. stocks rose and Treasury yields fell on the day as the CPI figures strengthened bets for another rate cut early next year.
          The idea wasn’t “inflation is solved,” but rather: <em>inflation is not re-accelerating aggressively, so the cut path stays alive.</em></p>

        <h3>1.3 Earnings catalyst: Micron reignites AI optimism</h3>
        <p>On <strong>December 17, 2025</strong>, Reuters reported Micron’s forecast implying a major upside surprise versus consensus,
          driven by higher memory chip prices and demand from AI data centers.
          That kind of print tends to spill over beyond one company: it becomes a “theme validator” for the broader AI hardware stack.</p>

        <p>On <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>, Reuters described Micron reaching a record closing high and lifting other AI-linked names,
          reinforcing the idea that “the AI trade” was not dead — it was just becoming more selective and more earnings-sensitive.</p>

        <h2>2. Interpretation: What It Means (Macro → Rates → Equities)</h2>

        <h3>2.1 The macro channel: CPI changes the discount-rate conversation</h3>
        <p>A softer CPI print tends to do two things at once:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Policy expectations:</strong> markets increase the probability of earlier or deeper cuts.</li>
          <li><strong>Duration bid:</strong> long-duration equities (especially tech) often benefit as discount rates fall.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This week illustrated that dynamic clearly: inflation relief opened the door for tech to bounce.
          But the deeper lesson is that CPI doesn’t “cause” a rally by magic — it changes the rate path and the valuation math.</p>

        <h3>2.2 The micro channel: the AI theme now needs proof</h3>
        <p>Micron’s AI-linked outlook acted as proof-of-demand for data-center spending.
          Many investors interpret this kind of confirmation as evidence that parts of the AI buildout are translating into real orders,
          not just optimistic presentations. That said, the market is increasingly differentiating between
          <strong>AI beneficiaries with visible cash-flow payoff</strong> and names where capex is high but monetization is vague.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Cross-check: when rates and earnings point in the same direction</h3>
        <p>The week was especially constructive for risk assets because two forces aligned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rates logic turned more supportive (softer CPI → cut odds up).</li>
          <li>Earnings logic improved for key AI hardware (Micron → demand signal up).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When those align, rallies tend to feel “cleaner” than when markets rise on pure narrative alone.</p>

        <h2>3. “Gossip” and Headline Culture (Carefully Framed)</h2>

        <p>This section reflects market chatter and media reporting themes, not guaranteed outcomes. It’s included because
          it often influences flows and positioning — especially in late December.</p>

        <h3>3.1 TikTok deal talk: Oracle back in the spotlight</h3>
        <p>Reuters reported that ByteDance signed agreements transferring control of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a new joint venture involving investors
          including <strong>Oracle</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong>. In that reporting, Oracle shares jumped on the news.
          In market conversation, stories like this tend to get framed as “optional upside” (cloud, data, influence) even if the economics are still evolving.</p>

        <h3>3.2 The fun bit: why December feels like “single-name season”</h3>
        <p>In year-end conditions, liquidity can be thinner and portfolios are being rebalanced. Many traders claim that this environment
          makes stocks more sensitive to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>guidance wording, not just numbers,</li>
          <li>deal rumors and regulatory headlines,</li>
          <li>and “theme validation” prints (like Micron) that refresh a popular narrative.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This doesn’t mean the market is irrational — it means the marginal buyer/seller can move price more than usual.</p>

        <h2>4. Practical Lessons for Models (DCF / cases / interviews)</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep top-down consistency:</strong> if CPI supports easier policy, your discount-rate assumptions should reflect that.</li>
          <li><strong>Separate theme from stock:</strong> AI can be real, but not every AI-linked stock deserves the same multiple.</li>
          <li><strong>Use scenario logic for deals:</strong> treat TikTok/Oracle headlines as optionality until structures and economics are fully clear.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch dispersion:</strong> in weeks like this, “index up” can hide major winners/losers underneath.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Bottom Line: The Week in One Sentence</h2>
        <p><strong>15–21 December 2025</strong> was the week inflation relief met AI earnings proof:
          CPI kept the cut narrative alive, and Micron gave the market a concrete reason to believe the AI cycle still has cash-flow momentum —
          while TikTok/Oracle headlines added an extra layer of “deal-driven entertainment.”</p>
