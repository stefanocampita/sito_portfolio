<p>This weekly recap covers <strong>29 December 2025 to 4 January 2026</strong>.
The key message is that the year started with a familiar tension:
<strong>fear of missing out (FOMO)</strong> on the rally that closed 2025,
versus <strong>caution ahead of the first major macro catalyst of the new year: payrolls.</strong></p>

<p>For finance students, this week is a clear example of how markets behave
when <strong>positioning resets</strong> after year-end constraints disappear,
and when investors prepare for a data-heavy January.</p>

<ul>
<li>Portfolios reset after year-end rebalancing,</li>
<li>Risk appetite returned but in a measured way,</li>
<li>Investors focused heavily on the upcoming U.S. jobs report (Jan 9),</li>
<li>Rates expectations for early 2026 remained the central narrative.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. The Context: New Year, Same Questions</h2>

<p>The first trading days of January often look deceptively calm.
But underneath, there is a structural change:
<strong>year-end reporting pressure disappears</strong>,
and managers regain flexibility to add risk again.</p>

<p>This often creates a phenomenon described by market commentators as
<strong>“January FOMO”</strong> — investors who reduced exposure in late December
now feel pressure to re-enter positions, especially in winning themes
like AI, tech, and growth.</p>

<h2>2. The Real Driver: Payrolls Setup</h2>

<p>Throughout this week, market commentary repeatedly pointed to the
<strong>January 9 Employment Situation report</strong> as the first real test
of whether the “soft landing + rate cuts” narrative could continue.</p>

<p>The logic was straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>If payrolls show cooling but not collapse → rate cuts remain likely → risk assets supported.</li>
<li>If payrolls show unexpected strength → cuts may be delayed → pressure on high-duration equities.</li>
</ul>

<p>This made the week less about what happened, and more about what could happen.</p>

<h2>3. Equities: FOMO Returns, but Selectively</h2>

<p>Several market observers noted that risk appetite returned at the start of the year,
but not indiscriminately. Rather than a broad euphoric rally, buying appeared
<strong>selective</strong> and concentrated in areas with strong 2025 momentum.</p>

<ul>
<li>AI and semiconductor names regained attention,</li>
<li>Some defensive sectors lagged as investors leaned back into growth,</li>
<li>Index moves looked moderate, but stock-level moves were more pronounced.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is typical of early January: money flows back in, but investors
are still cautious until the first big macro print confirms the path.</p>

<h2>4. The Gossip (market chatter, not fact)</h2>

<h3>4.1 “Everyone waiting for payrolls”</h3>
<p>Many traders described the week as a holding pattern. The phrase
<em>“no one wants to be wrong before payrolls”</em> appeared frequently
in market commentary, reflecting how positioning was cautious despite
improving risk sentiment.</p>

<h3>4.2 “January rally?” discussions</h3>
<p>Financial strategists debated whether the typical January inflow effect
would combine with easing expectations to produce another strong rally,
or whether markets were already too extended after a strong end to 2025.</p>

<h2>5. Rates &amp; Macro Expectations</h2>

<p>The bond market stayed relatively stable, but the narrative was clear:
everything now depended on whether labor data would validate the
disinflation and easing path suggested by December CPI and the Fed’s tone.</p>

<p>This meant discount-rate expectations were not changing yet —
but they were extremely sensitive to the next data point.</p>

<h2>6. Lessons for Models and Interviews</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Positioning reset matters:</strong> flows in early January can move markets even before data.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation weeks are important:</strong> sometimes markets trade what is coming, not what happened.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario thinking:</strong> payrolls become a binary catalyst for risk assets.</li>
<li><strong>Selective buying:</strong> not all sectors benefit equally from renewed risk appetite.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<p><strong>29 Dec 2025 – 4 Jan 2026</strong> was a transition week:
the market shifted from year-end positioning to new-year opportunity,
with investors carefully rebuilding risk exposure while waiting for
the first major macro confirmation of 2026.</p>
