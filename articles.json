Because businesses with similar governance and social responsibility values are more likely to align operationally and culturally, they make post-deal integration easier. Additionally, ESG can make it possible to access less expensive financing, like sustainability-linked loans, which lower the cost of capital by rewarding businesses with lower interest rates for achieving sustainability goals.
