<p>This weekly recap covers <strong>5 to 11 January 2026</strong>.  
The key message is simple but powerful:  
<strong>the first major macro test of the year — U.S. payrolls — forced markets to reprice rate expectations</strong>, and with it, sector leadership and risk appetite.</p>

<p>After two weeks dominated by positioning, anticipation, and thin liquidity, this was the week where <strong>real data came back into control of markets.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Payrolls surprised relative to expectations,</li>
<li>Yields reacted quickly, especially on the short end,</li>
<li>Equities showed clear rotation between growth and defensives,</li>
<li>Rate-cut timing for 2026 was actively reassessed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. The Event: January Payrolls (Jan 9)</h2>

<p>The U.S. Employment Situation report became the focal point of the week.
After weeks of discussing what <em>might</em> happen, investors finally had
a concrete data point to update their models.</p>

<p>The payrolls print showed that the labor market remains
<strong>resilient but gradually cooling</strong> — not weak enough to signal
recession, but not hot enough to invalidate the disinflation narrative.</p>

<p>This is exactly the type of data that creates market tension:
it supports the soft-landing story, but does not justify aggressive
rate cuts in the very short term.</p>

<h2>2. Rates: Immediate repricing</h2>

<p>Yields, especially on the 2-year Treasury, reacted swiftly.
Investors adjusted probabilities for the timing of the first rate cut,
pushing expectations slightly further out compared to what was priced
at the end of December.</p>

<p>This movement, while not dramatic, was enough to impact
high-duration equities and rate-sensitive sectors.</p>

<h2>3. Equities: Rotation clearly visible</h2>

<p>This was a textbook rotation week:</p>

<ul>
<li>High-duration growth and AI-heavy names experienced volatility,</li>
<li>Defensive sectors and value names outperformed during parts of the week,</li>
<li>Financials benefited from the yield move and curve dynamics,</li>
<li>Indices looked stable, but sector dispersion was high.</li>
</ul>

<p>For students, this is extremely important: the index can look calm,
while underneath a major repositioning is happening.</p>

<h2>4. Market Gossip & Desk Chatter</h2>

<h3>4.1 “This is why January matters”</h3>
<p>Many commentators highlighted that January macro data often sets
the tone for the first quarter. The phrase
<em>“January data defines Q1 positioning”</em> circulated widely
in market discussions.</p>

<h3>4.2 “AI names too sensitive to yields”</h3>
<p>Some investors noted that the violent reaction of certain AI and
semiconductor stocks to small yield changes revealed how crowded
those trades had become after 2025’s rally.</p>

<h2>5. Fixed Income & Credit</h2>

<p>Credit spreads remained relatively contained, reinforcing the idea
that this was not a stress event, but a repricing event.</p>

<p>The message from bonds was clear: policy is still moving toward
easing in 2026, but not as quickly as markets had started to hope
in late December.</p>

<h2>6. Lessons for Modelling and Interviews</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Payrolls are not just macro data</strong> — they are discount-rate data.</li>
<li><strong>Small yield changes can drive large equity moves</strong> in crowded trades.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation is often hidden by index stability.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Soft landing ≠ immediate easing.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<p><strong>5–11 January 2026</strong> was the first week where markets
moved from anticipation to reaction. Payrolls did not break the
soft-landing narrative, but they slowed down the market’s enthusiasm
for rapid rate cuts — and that was enough to trigger a visible
sector rotation.</p>

<aside class="callout">
<strong>Key takeaways (5–11 January 2026):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Payrolls forced markets to reassess rate-cut timing.</li>
<li>Yields moved modestly but impacted growth stocks strongly.</li>
<li>Clear rotation between growth, defensives, and financials.</li>
<li>Index stability hid meaningful sector repositioning.</li>
</ul>
