      <!-- ARTICLE BODY -->
      <article class="card article-content">

        <p>This fourth weekly recap covers the period from
          <strong>24 to 30 November 2025</strong>, a week shaped by three elements:
          the return of delayed U.S. labour data, a short trading week around
          Thanksgiving, and visible stress in parts of the crypto and equity
          complex. For finance students, it is a useful snapshot of how markets
          digest fresh macro information when liquidity is lower than usual.</p>

        <p>In broad terms, the week can be framed around four themes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>labour market slack continues to build,</li>
          <li>the Fed’s message stays cautious and somewhat split,</li>
          <li>equities hold up thanks to mega-cap tech, while breadth is weak,</li>
          <li>Bitcoin and other risk assets outside mainstream equities come under pressure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. Macro Data: Labour Market Slack Is Now Clear in the Numbers</h2>

        <p>The most important macro development this week was the release of
          delayed U.S. labour market data, which confirmed something markets
          had already suspected: <strong>the labour market is loosening</strong>.</p>

        <h3>1.1 Payrolls and unemployment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Nonfarm payrolls showed an increase of around
            <strong>119,000 jobs</strong>, a clear improvement compared with earlier
            weak months but still below the pace seen at the peak of the expansion.</li>
          <li>The <strong>unemployment rate rose to about 4.4%</strong>,
            a four-year high. Importantly, the increase in unemployment was not only
            about job losses but also about more people coming back into the labour
            force and not finding work immediately.</li>
          <li>Wage growth stayed moderate, at roughly
            <strong>0.2% month-on-month</strong> and around the high-3% range
            year-on-year, consistent with cooling but not collapsing wage pressures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the macro narrative, this combination can be summarised as:
          <strong>“more jobs, but more unemployed workers”</strong>. From a policy
          perspective, it gives the Fed room to ease in the future, but it also
          raises concerns about the strength of household income and consumption.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Labour market slack indicators</h3>
        <p>Several indicators of labour market slack all moved in the same
          direction:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the unemployment rate reached a multi-year high,</li>
          <li>survey measures of jobs being “hard to get” vs “plentiful”
            pointed toward rising difficulty in finding employment,</li>
          <li>continuing claims rose, signalling that unemployed workers were
            taking longer to find new jobs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For students, this is a clear example of how you should not look at
          <em>only one</em> labour indicator. Slack is a concept: you infer it
          from several measures moving in the same direction.</p>

        <h2>2. Monetary Policy: Fed Minutes and a Divided Outlook</h2>

        <p>With labour market slack now more visible, attention turned to what
          the Federal Reserve might do next. During the week, minutes and
          commentary from policymakers revealed that the Committee is
          <strong>divided on the pace and scale of future cuts</strong>.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Fed minutes: key points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some officials argued that the rise in unemployment and growing
            slack justified further easing, potentially as soon as the December
            meeting.</li>
          <li>Others remained focused on inflation risks, highlighting that
            underlying price pressures had not yet fully normalised.</li>
          <li>Markets interpreted the minutes as confirmation of a
            <strong>data-dependent Fed</strong> rather than a pre-committed
            cutting cycle.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From a discount-rate perspective, investors still expect lower policy
          rates over the next 12–18 months, but the probability distribution
          shifted toward <strong>fewer or later cuts</strong> compared with
          earlier in the autumn.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Thanksgiving and liquidity</h3>
        <p>The week was also affected by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>U.S. markets were closed on Thursday and traded half-day on Friday,</li>
          <li>volumes were generally lower throughout the week,</li>
          <li>macro news had a potentially larger impact on prices because there
            were fewer participants and less depth in order books.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is important when you later read price charts: a large intraday
          move in a low-liquidity environment does not always mean a large
          shift in fundamentals.</p>

        <h2>3. Equities: Tech Strength vs Weak Breadth</h2>

        <p>Equity markets came into the week with cautious optimism. By the
          end of the period, the picture was mixed: headline indices held up
          relatively well, but the <strong>underlying breadth remained weak</strong>.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Headline performance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Major U.S. indices such as the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq started
            the week with gains, helped by continued strength in
            <strong>mega-cap tech and AI-linked names</strong>.</li>
          <li>Investors focused on the idea that more labour market slack
            would reduce inflation and eventually prompt further rate cuts,
            which is typically supportive for growth stocks.</li>
          <li>Toward the end of the week, gains moderated as participants
            became more cautious and digested the implications of the jobs data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Under the surface: breadth and dispersion</h3>
        <p>Despite stable or modestly higher indices, the damage under the
          surface remained clear:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a large share of individual stocks were well below their highs,</li>
          <li>many mid-cap and smaller names had already experienced
            double-digit drawdowns,</li>
          <li>sector performance was uneven, with technology and a few
            high-quality growth names doing much better than the median stock.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For anyone studying market structure, this is a reminder that a
          “bull market” can coexist with significant weakness across a large
          part of the equity universe. From a portfolio perspective, it
          raises questions about concentration risk and diversification.</p>

        <h2>4. Fixed Income &amp; FX: Yields Ease, Dollar Dynamics</h2>

        <p>Bond and currency markets spent the week digesting the new
          labour-market information and the Fed minutes.</p>

        <h3>4.1 Bond yields</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Short-term yields</strong> were sensitive to shifting
            expectations about the December meeting and early-2026 policy path.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term yields</strong> moved lower at times, reflecting
            both the weaker labour backdrop and a modest reduction in term
            premium as the perceived probability of an uncontrolled inflation
            scenario declined.</li>
          <li>Overall, the yield curve remained inverted, but with slightly
            lower yields across much of the curve compared to earlier in
            the quarter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 FX markets</h3>
        <p>In FX, the picture was more nuanced:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the <strong>U.S. dollar</strong> moved in a narrow range, balancing
            the impact of lower yields against its role as a safe-haven currency,</li>
          <li>currencies of economies more exposed to global trade or to
            commodity cycles reacted to changes in risk appetite and rate
            differentials,</li>
          <li>overall, FX moves were consistent with a world where growth
            worries are increasing but not yet dominant.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From a corporate finance angle, these FX moves matter for the
          translation of foreign earnings and for the competitiveness of
          exporters, particularly in sectors like technology, autos, and
          industrials.</p>

        <h2>5. Commodities: Stable Gold, Softer Oil</h2>

        <p>In commodities, the week did not bring dramatic new highs, but it
          did reinforce existing trends.</p>

        <h3>5.1 Precious metals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gold</strong> remained elevated by historical standards,
            supported by a combination of lower yields, central-bank demand,
            and ongoing macro uncertainty.</li>
          <li>Even without fresh record highs, the level of gold prices
            continued to signal strong demand for hedging and diversification.</li>
          <li><strong>Silver</strong> and other metals moved in line with a
            mix of safe-haven and industrial-demand drivers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Energy and industrials</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Oil prices</strong> eased somewhat as markets weighed
            softer demand indicators against ongoing supply constraints.</li>
          <li>Industrial commodities reacted to revised expectations for
            global manufacturing and trade, especially in Europe and Asia.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For students, this is a good reminder that commodities often express
          the market’s view on both <strong>growth</strong> and <strong>risk</strong>:
          lower oil prices can signal concerns about future demand, while
          high gold prices signal concerns about uncertainty and financial risk.</p>

        <h2>6. Crypto and Alternatives: Bitcoin Sends a Caution Signal</h2>

        <p>One of the clearest warning signals this week came from crypto.
          Bitcoin and other major digital assets extended the decline that
          had started earlier in the month.</p>

        <h3>6.1 Bitcoin performance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bitcoin traded more than 30% below its recent
            all-time high</strong> and recorded one of its worst months of 2025.</li>
          <li>ETF outflows and losses among short-term holders contributed
            to selling pressure.</li>
          <li>Analysts pointed to Bitcoin as an <strong>“early warning
            indicator”</strong> for risk appetite, especially for highly
            levered or speculative strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a student of markets, this behaviour is interesting because
          crypto often moves ahead of more traditional risk assets, especially
          when the story is about liquidity and speculative excess rather
          than pure macro fundamentals.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Other alternatives</h3>
        <p>Other alternative assets, such as private credit and real assets,
          did not show the same volatility on a weekly basis, but the broader
          conversation about valuations and liquidity risk continued in the
          background.</p>

        <h2>7. Global &amp; Regional Stories</h2>

        <p>While U.S. data dominated the week, there were also important
          developments elsewhere:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>in the <strong>UK</strong>, investors looked ahead to a key budget
            announcement, with gilts pricing the risk of higher taxes to
            stabilise public finances,</li>
          <li>in the <strong>euro area</strong>, flash PMIs suggested modest
            growth and persistent divergence between stronger and weaker
            member states,</li>
          <li>in some <strong>emerging markets</strong>, local bond auctions
            and currency moves reflected both domestic policy challenges and
            the global search for yield.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This reinforces a recurring point: even when the U.S. sets the
          tone for global markets, local factors can strongly influence
          relative performance across countries and regions.</p>

        <h2>8. What This Week Teaches a Finance Student</h2>

        <p>From a learning perspective, 24–30 November 2025 offers several
          lessons that are directly useful for both academic work and
          professional practice:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Slack vs growth:</strong> a labour market can be
            generating jobs and still be loosening if unemployment and
            continuing claims rise. When you model consumption or default
            risk, both aspects matter.</li>

          <li><strong>Fed communication:</strong> minutes and speeches are
            signals to be interpreted, not mechanical instructions. Markets
            responded to the <em>distribution</em> of views inside the Fed,
            not just to the last decision.</li>

          <li><strong>Headline indices vs breadth:</strong> when a few mega-cap
            names hold up the index while many stocks trade far below their
            highs, the risk profile of “the market” is very different from
            what the index level suggests.</li>

          <li><strong>Liquidity and seasonality:</strong> short holiday weeks
            can amplify price moves without a proportional change in
            fundamentals. When you backtest strategies or interpret charts,
            controlling for this is important.</li>

          <li><strong>Alternative signals:</strong> crypto, gold, and other
            non-traditional assets can act as early warning indicators for
            shifts in risk appetite and liquidity conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In summary, the week of 24–30 November 2025 marked a shift from
          political drama to <strong>data-driven concern about growth and
          labour markets</strong>, with mixed but telling signals across
          equities, bonds, FX, commodities, and crypto. For anyone studying
          or practising finance, it’s a neat case study in how markets react
          when macro data finally catch up with what sentiment had already
          started to price in.</p>
