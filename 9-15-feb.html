      <article class="card article-content">

        <p>This weekly recap covers the period from
          <strong>9 February to 15 February 2026</strong>. The defining theme was a rare combination:
          a week with a real macro catalyst (<strong>US CPI</strong>) and a notably active <strong>deal tape</strong>.
          Softer inflation kept easing expectations alive, while mergers, take-private activity, and boardroom drama
          provided additional fuel for cross-asset narratives.</p>

        <p>For finance students, this week is useful because it shows how price action can be driven by:
          <strong>fundamentals</strong> (data and policy expectations), <strong>narratives</strong> (sector-level fragility), and
          <strong>corporate actions</strong> (M&amp;A structure and premiums) — all at the same time.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>US CPI came in softer</strong> — supporting the view that easing remains “in play” later in the year.</li>
          <li><strong>Equities avoided a broad panic</strong> — but dispersion and rotation remained the real story.</li>
          <li><strong>M&amp;A was a main character</strong> — multiple large transactions shaped sentiment and valuation anchors.</li>
          <li><strong>Deal gossip mattered</strong> — activism, ticking fees, and breakup-fee politics became tradable narratives.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Numbers snapshot (9–15 Feb 2026)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>US CPI (Jan, released Feb 13):</strong> <strong>+0.2%</strong> m/m; <strong>+2.4%</strong> y/y.</li>
          <li><strong>NatWest / Evelyn Partners:</strong> <strong>£2.7bn</strong> (including debt).</li>
          <li><strong>Nuveen / Schroders:</strong> <strong>£9.9bn</strong> takeover value.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear Channel Outdoor:</strong> <strong>$6.2bn</strong> enterprise value; <strong>$2.43/share</strong> cash.</li>
          <li><strong>Deutsche Börse / ISS STOXX (minority stake):</strong> <strong>€1.1bn</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Lilly / Orna Therapeutics:</strong> up to <strong>$2.4bn</strong> in cash.</li>
          <li><strong>Paramount–WBD “ticking fee”:</strong> <strong>$0.25/share per quarter</strong> (from 2027 until close) proposed in a revised offer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. Macro &amp; Policy Backdrop: A Data-Catalyst Week</h2>

        <p>The central macro print was the January U.S. Consumer Price Index, released on <strong>Feb 13</strong>:
          <strong>+0.2%</strong> month-over-month and <strong>+2.4%</strong> year-over-year.</p>

        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> markets move on the marginal surprise. A modest downside versus expectations can matter
          because it shifts the distribution of outcomes for the first cut — even if the economy itself did not “change” overnight.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> discount-rate assumptions can ease at the margin without requiring a growth scare.
          The real risk is second-order: if future inflation prints re-accelerate, the “cuts later this year” narrative can unwind quickly.</p>

        <h2>2. Cross-Asset Read: Controlled Repricing, Not a Panic Regime</h2>

        <p>After the CPI print, the overall configuration looked more like a controlled adjustment than a systemic break:
          repricing in rates was not discontinuous, and equities did not behave as if a macro alarm had suddenly triggered.</p>

        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> this is consistent with a “fundamentals nudge,” not a wholesale regime switch.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> in case work, you should treat this as a scenario-design week:
          data shifts the expected path, while positioning and narrative risk determine how violently assets react.</p>

        <h2>3. Equities: Index-Level Resilience, Sector-Level Fragility</h2>

        <p>Equities did not capitulate. The better lens was dispersion: specific sectors and single-name narratives remained volatile,
          even when broad indices looked stable.</p>

        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> markets can be “fine” at index level while fragile under the surface. Dispersion and correlation shifts
          often appear before index drawdowns.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> students should separate “market beta” from “factor/sector risk.”
          Many real-world drawdowns are portfolio problems (exposure concentration) more than index problems.</p>

        <h2>4. M&amp;A &amp; Corporate Actions: The Week’s Second Engine</h2>

        <p>This was a busy deal week. Corporate actions provided valuation anchors (premiums), changed competitive narratives, and created
          situation-specific catalysts.</p>

        <h3>4.1 NatWest buys Evelyn Partners (wealth management scale)</h3>
        <p>NatWest agreed to buy Evelyn Partners for <strong>£2.7bn</strong> (including debt), a strategic push deeper into wealth management.</p>
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> this is a bet on fee-like revenues and client “stickiness” as rate-driven net interest income becomes less reliable.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> when large banks pay up for wealth platforms, it can signal a broader industry pivot toward stability and diversification.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Nuveen buys Schroders (asset management consolidation)</h3>
        <p>Nuveen agreed to buy Schroders for <strong>£9.9bn</strong>, ending the independence of a historic UK asset manager and highlighting the scale trend.</p>
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> in asset management, distribution and operating leverage matter when fee pressure and passive competition persist.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> consolidation may lift valuations short term (takeout premium), but long-term value depends on integration and retention.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Clear Channel Outdoor taken private (public-market discount vs private capital)</h3>
        <p>Clear Channel Outdoor agreed to be acquired in a <strong>$6.2bn</strong> enterprise value deal, paying <strong>$2.43/share</strong> in cash.</p>
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> this is private capital exploiting a public-market discount — especially in sectors where narrative risk compresses multiples.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> large take-private premiums are a reminder that public markets can over-penalize “unloved” assets in risk-on/risk-off cycles.</p>

        <h3>4.4 Deutsche Börse buys remaining minority stake in ISS STOXX (data/indices as recurring revenue)</h3>
        <p>Deutsche Börse agreed to acquire the remaining minority stake in ISS STOXX for <strong>€1.1bn</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> exchanges keep building “data &amp; indices” stacks because recurring revenues tend to be resilient across regimes.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> market infrastructure often monetizes volatility: when investors are nervous, demand for data, analytics and benchmarks rises.</p>

        <h3>4.5 Lilly buys Orna Therapeutics (platform optionality)</h3>
        <p>Eli Lilly agreed to buy Orna Therapeutics for up to <strong>$2.4bn</strong> in cash.</p>
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> this is an R&amp;D call option: paying for platform upside and pipeline optionality rather than near-term earnings.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> in equity analysis, acquisitions like this matter for “narrative durability” — they can reduce concentration risk around one franchise.</p>

        <h2>5. Deal “Gossip” That Mattered: WBD, Ticking Fees, and Activist Pressure</h2>

        <p>Some of the most tradable headlines were not “macro” at all — they were deal mechanics and shareholder politics.</p>

        <p>Paramount Skydance revised its posture around Warner Bros. Discovery by adding a <strong>$0.25/share</strong> quarterly ticking fee (from 2027 until close),
          and agreeing to cover a potential breakup fee tied to the competing Netflix arrangement.</p>

        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> this is M&amp;A game theory: headline price is only one variable — structure, timing risk, regulatory risk, and break fees can dominate outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong>What this implies:</strong> students should model deals like options: timing uncertainty and conditional payments can meaningfully change expected value.</p>

        <h2>6. Takeaways (9–15 Feb 2026)</h2>

        <p>This week illustrated how markets digest a macro surprise while simultaneously trading corporate actions and narrative risk. The macro print
          mattered, but so did the deal tape — and the most “gossipy” stories were still capital-relevant.</p>

        <!-- CALL OUT -->
        <aside class="callout">
          <strong>Key takeaways (9–15 Feb 2026):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Macro catalyst:</strong> US CPI (Jan) printed <strong>+0.2% m/m</strong> and <strong>+2.4% y/y</strong>, supporting easing expectations at the margin.</li>
            <li><strong>No broad panic:</strong> cross-asset repricing looked controlled rather than systemic.</li>
            <li><strong>M&amp;A was central:</strong> wealth, asset management, data/indices, and healthcare deals shaped sentiment and valuation anchors.</li>
            <li><strong>Deal structure mattered:</strong> ticking fees, break-fee politics and activism became tradable narratives.</li>
            <li><strong>For students:</strong> treat weeks like this as a reminder that markets move on marginal surprises — and that corporate actions can move prices as much as macro.</li>
          </ul>
