      <article class="card article-content">

        <p>This second weekly recap looks at what happened in global markets between
          <strong>10 and 16 November 2025</strong>. The dominant story was the
          <strong>end of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history</strong>,
          which triggered a relief rally but left investors with big questions about
          growth, policy, and valuations. As in the previous week, the aim here is
          to connect macro data, policy decisions, and cross-asset moves in a way
          that is useful for finance students who are building models, doing case
          studies, or preparing for interviews.</p>

        <p>At a high level, the week can be summarised in four blocks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the shutdown ends and political risk falls sharply,</li>
          <li>monetary policy expectations remain uncertain,</li>
          <li>equities rally but with clear sector rotations, and</li>
          <li>bond yields, FX and commodities adjust to the new regime.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. Macro &amp; Policy: The Shutdown Finally Ends</h2>

        <p>The key macro event was political rather than economic: after 43 days,
          the U.S. federal government shutdown was finally resolved. This had been
          the longest shutdown in modern U.S. history and had already delayed the
          release of several important data series (including labour and inflation
          indicators) and created uncertainty around public spending and confidence.</p>

        <h3>1.1 Immediate market reaction</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Equities opened the week on a positive tone</strong>, with a clear
            <em>relief rally</em> once a deal to reopen the government was confirmed.</li>
          <li>Investors priced out some of the tail risk associated with a prolonged
            disruption in public services and data availability.</li>
          <li>Risk assets benefited from the perception that a systemic political risk
            had been removed, at least in the short run.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For markets, the key point is that the end of the shutdown did not
          immediately change fundamentals such as earnings or productivity.
          What changed was the <strong>distribution of scenarios</strong>: a very
          negative tail outcome (shutdown extending for months) became much less
          likely, which is typically supportive for risk assets.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Policy focus after the shutdown</h3>
        <p>With the immediate political risk reduced, attention shifted back to
          <strong>monetary policy</strong> and to how the Federal Reserve might react
          to a weakening economy. Market pricing reflected two ideas at the same time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>on one hand, the end of the shutdown was positive for confidence,</li>
          <li>on the other hand, the damage done to activity and sentiment could still
            appear in the data over the following weeks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This tension explains why the week’s narrative is a mix of
          “relief rally” and “data uncertainty”, rather than a simple risk-on story.</p>

        <h2>2. Monetary Policy Expectations: Cuts, but How Many and How Fast?</h2>

        <p>After the shutdown ended, markets again focused on the question:
          <strong>how far will the Fed go in easing?</strong> The answer was not clear,
          and that uncertainty was reflected in pricing in rates, FX, and equities.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Signals from the Fed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some Fed officials hinted that if growth weakened materially, additional
            <strong>rate cuts</strong> or even renewed <strong>quantitative easing (QE)</strong>
            could be considered.</li>
          <li>Others stressed that inflation pressures were still not fully under control
            and that the central bank should avoid over-reacting.</li>
          <li>The implied probability of another 25 bps cut in December decreased compared
            to the previous week, suggesting that investors were reassessing the pace of
            easing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a student, this is a clean example of how markets deal with internal
          disagreement within a central bank: rather than pricing only one outcome,
          they assign probabilities to multiple scenarios (faster cuts, slower cuts,
          or a pause) and then express those probabilities in the shape of the yield
          curve and in futures pricing.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Why the timing of cuts matters for valuation</h3>
        <p>From a DCF perspective, the timing and size of rate cuts affect both:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the <strong>discount rate</strong> (via the risk-free component), and</li>
          <li>the <strong>path of cash flows</strong> (if easier policy supports growth).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In this week, investors were more confident that the general direction
          of policy was toward easing, but less confident about how quickly that
          easing would materialise. Therefore, the impact on valuations was
          supportive but not explosive.</p>

        <h2>3. Data &amp; Uncertainty: When the Numbers Are Missing</h2>

        <p>One unusual aspect of this period is that, because of the shutdown,
          several key macro series were delayed or unavailable. That forced traders
          and analysts to rely more heavily on alternative indicators.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Alternative indicators</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Private employment data</strong> (such as ADP) continued to show
            job creation, although at a slower pace than earlier in the year.</li>
          <li><strong>Business surveys</strong> pointed to softer activity, especially
            in manufacturing and interest-rate-sensitive sectors.</li>
          <li><strong>Consumer confidence measures</strong> remained subdued, reflecting
            the combined effects of previous rate hikes and political noise.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The key point is that these alternative indicators painted a picture of an
          economy that is <strong>slowing but not yet in recession</strong>. However, because
          the usual “official” data were not fully available, the confidence intervals
          around that diagnosis were wide, and that uncertainty fed directly into
          market volatility.</p>

        <h2>4. Equities: Relief Rally, But Not a Broad-Based Party</h2>

        <p>Equity markets reacted positively at the start of the week when the shutdown
          was resolved, but that strength was not evenly distributed. For anyone looking
          beyond the index level, the structure of the moves is as important as the
          headline returns.</p>

        <h3>4.1 Index-level performance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>U.S. large caps</strong> (S&amp;P 500) recorded modest gains on the week,
            supported by relief on the political side and by still-solid earnings.</li>
          <li><strong>Growth-heavy indices</strong>, such as the Nasdaq, were choppy: they
            benefited from the improved risk sentiment but were capped by valuation
            concerns and sensitivity to rates.</li>
          <li>Outside the U.S., performance was mixed, with some European and Asian markets
            underperforming due to their own local issues and lower earnings momentum.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Sector and style rotations</h3>
        <p>Under the surface, investors continued to shift exposure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technology and high-growth names</strong> remained a central focus.
            In many cases, strong earnings were required just to justify current levels.
            Any disappointment was punished quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Cyclicals and value sectors</strong> (industrials, parts of financials,
            selected consumer names) showed relative strength when investors focused on
            the positive signal from the shutdown ending and the possibility of lower
            rates ahead.</li>
          <li><strong>Defensive sectors</strong> (utilities, staples, healthcare) held their
            ground, as some investors preferred to maintain protection against a more
            negative macro scenario.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For students, this week is another reminder that equity markets can show
          <strong>“cautious risk-on”</strong>: indices move higher, but investors still rotate
          within the market to balance upside participation with downside protection.</p>

        <h2>5. Fixed Income &amp; FX: Pricing the New Risk Mix</h2>

        <p>In bond and currency markets, the end of the shutdown and the ongoing debate
          about monetary policy translated into nuanced moves.</p>

        <h3>5.1 Bond yields</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Short-term yields</strong> adjusted to revised expectations for
            upcoming Fed meetings. With the probability of an immediate December cut
            lower than before, the very front end of the curve moved slightly higher
            or stabilised.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term yields</strong> were influenced more by changing inflation
            expectations and by the reduced political risk. Lower risk premia on U.S.
            Treasuries can compress long-term yields even if the immediate policy rate
            path is uncertain.</li>
          <li>The result was a small adjustment in the curve shape, but no dramatic
            steepening or inversion change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Foreign exchange</h3>
        <p>FX markets also reacted to the new information set:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>U.S. dollar</strong> softened at moments when risk appetite
            improved and markets leaned toward more easing over the medium term.</li>
          <li><strong>European currencies</strong> moved in line with yield differentials
            and with expectations about the ECB’s reaction function.</li>
          <li>Safe-haven currencies and assets remained in demand, but less aggressively
            than during the height of the shutdown uncertainty.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From a portfolio construction angle, this is a reminder that FX and fixed income
          are tightly linked: when you change assumptions about policy and risk premia,
          you immediately change the relative attractiveness of government bonds across
          regions and, therefore, the direction of capital flows.</p>

        <h2>6. Commodities &amp; Crypto: Hedging and Speculation Continue</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Commodities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gold</strong> traded in a relatively tight range. The end of the
            shutdown reduced political risk, but persistent macro uncertainty and debate
            about future policy kept demand for hedges alive.</li>
          <li><strong>Oil</strong> remained sensitive to expectations about global demand,
            particularly from large economies, and to supply decisions by major producers.</li>
          <li>Other commodities, especially industrial metals, responded to shifting
            expectations about manufacturing and global trade.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In valuation terms, the week underlines how commodities respond not only to
          physical supply and demand but also to <strong>changes in uncertainty</strong>.
          A reduction in extreme downside scenarios can reduce the price of insurance
          (gold, for example) even if the central macro view is unchanged.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Cryptoassets</h3>
        <p>In digital assets, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies experienced a
          weaker tone mid-week. After previous strong moves, some investors used the
          improved risk sentiment in traditional markets to take profits in more
          speculative positions. Crypto continues to behave as a high-beta expression
          of global liquidity and risk appetite rather than as a pure hedge.</p>

        <h2>7. Global Markets: Uneven Transmission of a U.S. Story</h2>

        <p>Although the shutdown and its resolution were U.S. events, their impact was
          felt globally. However, the transmission was not uniform:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some <strong>European indices</strong> struggled due to weaker local growth
            expectations and sector composition, despite the improved global risk tone.</li>
          <li>Certain <strong>Asian markets</strong> benefited more from the prospect of
            stabilising U.S. demand and from currency moves that favoured exports.</li>
          <li>Emerging markets generally reacted positively to lower perceived U.S.
            political risk and the possibility of easier global financial conditions,
            but idiosyncratic stories (domestic politics, local inflation) remained
            crucial.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For students thinking about global asset allocation, this week is a practical
          example of why you need to look at both <strong>global drivers</strong> (like U.S.
          policy and risk sentiment) and <strong>local fundamentals</strong> when interpreting
          relative performance.</p>

        <h2>8. What This Week Teaches a Finance Student</h2>

        <p>Putting everything together, the week of 10–16 November 2025 reinforces
          several key principles that are useful in both academic and professional
          finance settings:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Risk is about distributions, not point forecasts.</strong> The end
            of the shutdown did not change the central macro forecast overnight, but it
            removed extreme negative scenarios, which is enough to move prices.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy expectations matter as much as current policy.</strong> What
            investors believe the Fed will do over the next 6–12 months is often more
            important for valuations than the last 25 bps change.</li>
          <li><strong>Data gaps create uncertainty premiums.</strong> When official data
            are missing or delayed, markets lean on alternative indicators and widen
            their confidence intervals, which can increase volatility.</li>
          <li><strong>Index performance can hide significant rotations.</strong> Even in
            a week with modest index moves, rotations between growth, value, cyclicals
            and defensives can be large and meaningful.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-asset consistency is key.</strong> The stories in equities,
            bonds, FX, commodities, and crypto should be read together. When they line
            up, the market narrative is usually more robust.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are using these weekly recaps as inputs for DCFs, LBOs, or trading
          ideas, the takeaway is that we are in a phase of
          <strong>cautious optimism</strong>: political risk has been reduced, the
          direction of policy is cautiously supportive, but data uncertainty and
          valuation levels leave little room for complacency.</p>
