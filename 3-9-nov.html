      <!-- ARTICLE BODY -->
      <article class="card article-content">

        <p>This is the first weekly instalment of a series that tracks how macro data, central banks, and cross-asset moves interact over time. The focus is simple: if you are a finance student, you should be able to read this recap and understand not only <em>what</em> happened in markets between 3 and 9 November 2025, but also <em>why it matters</em> for valuation, risk, and portfolio construction.</p>

        <p>The week was driven by three main forces:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the latest step in the Federal Reserve’s shift from tight to less restrictive policy,</li>
          <li>signals from trade and global activity that shaped growth expectations, and</li>
          <li>sector rotations below the surface of “stable” headline equity indices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. Macro &amp; Central Banks: A Cautious Fed, Divergent Paths</h2>

        <p>The dominant macro story was monetary policy. The Federal Reserve delivered another 25 bps rate cut, moving the federal funds target range lower while clearly signalling that the pace of future cuts is not guaranteed.</p>

        <h3>1.1 What the Fed did</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Decision:</strong> 25 bps cut, moving rates down but leaving policy still restrictive in real terms.</li>
          <li><strong>Message:</strong> the door is open to more easing, but only if inflation keeps trending lower and the labour market weakens further.</li>
          <li><strong>Market takeaway:</strong> expectations shifted from a rapid cutting cycle to a slower, data-dependent path.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a student point of view, this is a textbook case of the Fed managing the trade-off between:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inflation risk</strong> (cut too fast → risk of a second inflation wave), and</li>
          <li><strong>Growth and employment risk</strong> (stay too tight → risk of a sharper slowdown or recession).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Other central banks</h3>
        <p>The week also underlined that monetary policy is not moving in perfect sync across regions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> kept rates unchanged, stressing that current levels are “restrictive enough” but that premature easing could complicate the inflation path.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Bank of Japan</strong> left policy broadly unchanged as well, reflecting different inflation dynamics and the legacy of years of ultra-loose policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For global investors, this divergence matters because it affects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Capital flows</strong> (money moves toward higher real yields),</li>
          <li><strong>Exchange rates</strong> (rate differentials are a major FX driver), and</li>
          <li><strong>Relative equity performance</strong> (easier policy can support more leveraged or growth-sensitive markets).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Growth, Inflation &amp; Data: Reading the Signal Through the Noise</h2>

        <p>Alongside central bank decisions, markets received a series of macro signals that helped update expectations about growth and inflation going into year-end.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Labour market and activity</h3>
        <p>Even where full data were delayed or noisy, the message was consistent with a “cooling but not collapsing” economy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Employment indicators</strong> showed slower job creation compared to earlier in the year, but not a hard stop.</li>
          <li><strong>Survey data</strong> (business and consumer) softened at the margin, consistent with higher uncertainty as rates remain above pre-pandemic levels.</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacturing vs services</strong> continued to diverge, with factory activity relatively weaker and services more resilient.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Why this matters for valuation</h3>
        <p>From a valuation perspective, a slower but still positive growth environment is important because it tends to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Support <strong>earnings forecasts</strong> (no immediate need for deep downgrade cycles), while</li>
          <li>Justify a gradual move toward <strong>lower discount rates</strong> as inflation pressures ease.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That combination (slower growth + disinflation) is exactly what underpins the narrative of a potential “soft landing”. Equity and credit markets this week largely traded as if that scenario was still intact.</p>

        <h2>3. Equities: Calm Indices, Busy Under the Surface</h2>

        <p>On the surface, major indices like the S&amp;P 500 and global benchmarks posted only modest weekly moves. Underneath, however, there were notable shifts in sector and style performance.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Index-level performance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>U.S. large caps:</strong> slight gains on the week, helped by continued strength in selected growth and tech names.</li>
          <li><strong>U.S. small caps:</strong> underperformed, reflecting more sensitivity to domestic growth and financing conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Global equities:</strong> mixed, with some export-oriented markets benefitting from the trade headlines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Sector rotations</h3>
        <p>More interesting than index moves was the rotation within equities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technology:</strong> still a key driver of performance, but reactions to earnings were increasingly “binary” — strong results were needed just to keep prices stable.</li>
          <li><strong>Financials and cyclicals:</strong> showed periods of relative strength when markets focused on the benefits of lower funding costs and a still-growing economy.</li>
          <li><strong>Defensive sectors:</strong> such as utilities and consumer staples remained under demand from investors seeking resilience in case the slowdown accelerates.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a student, this is a reminder that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“The market” is not one thing — sector-level and factor-level moves often tell you more than the index.</li>
          <li>Rate expectations and sector sensitivity are tightly linked: lower rates tend to support duration-sensitive sectors (growth, tech), while a better growth outlook supports cyclicals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Fixed Income: Curves, Credit, and the Search for Yield</h2>

        <p>In fixed income, the Fed’s decision and communication played directly into yield curve dynamics.</p>

        <h3>4.1 Government bonds</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Short-term yields:</strong> reacted most directly to the Fed cut, easing slightly as markets priced a lower policy path.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term yields:</strong> remained more anchored by inflation expectations and term premia, moving less than the front end.</li>
          <li><strong>Curve shape:</strong> the inversion between short and long maturities persisted but showed signs of gradual flattening as the tightening cycle turned.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This combination is typical when the market thinks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The central bank is closer to the end of its hiking cycle, but</li>
          <li>Long-term inflation is still not fully “out of the way”.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Credit markets</h3>
        <p>Credit spreads were relatively stable:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Investment grade:</strong> remained tight, supported by solid balance sheets and strong demand for yield.</li>
          <li><strong>High yield:</strong> traded with more volatility, but without signs of systemic stress.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For students, the key link is that lower policy rates, if viewed as supportive rather than reactive to a crisis, tend to be <strong>positive for credit</strong>. If cuts were perceived as a response to an imminent recession, spreads would typically widen instead.</p>

        <h2>5. FX: Policy Divergence and the Dollar</h2>

        <p>In foreign exchange markets, rate differentials and relative growth expectations continued to drive performance.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>U.S. dollar:</strong> remained firm against a basket of currencies, supported by relatively higher yields and decent growth prospects.</li>
          <li><strong>Euro:</strong> was weaker at the margin, as markets saw less room for the ECB to cut aggressively without undermining inflation progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Yen:</strong> stayed under pressure given the Bank of Japan’s more accommodative stance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For valuation and portfolio allocation, this matters because FX movements feed directly into:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reported earnings of multinational firms,</li>
          <li>The performance of unhedged international equity positions, and</li>
          <li>The relative attractiveness of government bonds across regions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Commodities &amp; Crypto: Hedging and Speculation</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Commodities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gold:</strong> held at elevated levels, reflecting its role as both an inflation hedge and a hedge against policy or geopolitical mistakes.</li>
          <li><strong>Oil:</strong> traded in a range, with OPEC+ supply management offsetting concerns about slower demand growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Industrial metals:</strong> showed sensitivity to any headline that changed perceptions about global manufacturing and Chinese demand.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a student thinking about asset allocation, the main takeaway is that commodities are priced not only on spot supply/demand, but also on <strong>expectations</strong> of future activity and policy changes.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Cryptoassets</h3>
        <p>Digital assets such as Bitcoin spent the week consolidating after previous strong moves. Trading volumes were decent but not extreme, and flows into listed crypto products suggested that investors are treating crypto more as a high-beta play on liquidity and risk sentiment than as a pure macro hedge.</p>

        <h2>7. Key Risks and Market Narrative</h2>

        <p>Summarising the week’s narrative from a risk perspective:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Macro risk:</strong> the main question is whether the current slowdown stabilises (soft landing) or deepens (hard landing).</li>
          <li><strong>Policy risk:</strong> markets are sensitive to any sign that the Fed may have to either reverse its easing (if inflation re-accelerates) or accelerate it (if growth surprises on the downside).</li>
          <li><strong>Valuation risk:</strong> segments such as mega-cap tech remain rich relative to history, which amplifies the impact of any negative news on earnings or regulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> as we move closer to year-end, seasonal liquidity patterns can exaggerate price moves in both directions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. What This Week Teaches a Finance Student</h2>

        <p>From a learning standpoint, 3–9 November 2025 is a good laboratory week. It shows how multiple layers interact:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Top-down:</strong> central bank decisions and macro data shape the discount rate and growth narrative.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-asset:</strong> bonds, FX, commodities, and equities all respond to the same information but through different channels.</li>
          <li><strong>Bottom-up:</strong> sector and factor rotations inside the equity market reveal where investors think the new regime will create winners and losers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are building DCFs, LBOs, or thinking about portfolios, this week reinforces a few practical points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always link your assumptions on growth and discount rates to the current macro and policy backdrop.</li>
          <li>Watch the <strong>shape of the yield curve</strong>, not just the policy rate: it tells you how the market prices future risk.</li>
          <li>Look at <strong>market breadth</strong> — concentrated rallies can be more fragile than broad advances.</li>
          <li>Remember that risk assets can perform well even with “bad news” if the news is less bad than expected.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In short, the first week of November 2025 was not about dramatic headlines, but about confirmation: confirmation that we are in a phase of slower, but still positive growth; confirmation that central banks are easing cautiously; and confirmation that markets continue to reward those sectors and assets best positioned for that regime.</p>
