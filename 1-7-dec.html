      <article class="card article-content">

        <p>This fifth weekly recap covers the period from
          <strong>1 to 7 December 2025</strong>. The key message is that
          <strong>U.S. consumers kept spending aggressively at the start of the holiday season</strong>,
          even as confidence indicators dropped sharply. At the same time, equity markets
          remained relatively stable, reinforcing the idea that investors still see a
          potential <em>soft landing</em> rather than an imminent recession.</p>

        <p>For finance students, this week is a clear example of how
          <strong>behaviour (spending)</strong> and <strong>sentiment (confidence)</strong> can diverge,
          and what that means for earnings, valuations, and macro assumptions in models.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>holiday sales and retail indicators were surprisingly strong,</li>
          <li>consumer confidence dropped, highlighting a “mood vs behaviour” gap,</li>
          <li>equities stayed close to recent highs, with contained volatility,</li>
          <li>rate expectations and yields adjusted slightly but without a regime change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1. Macro Picture: Consumers Spend, Confidence Falls</h2>

        <p>The macro narrative this week revolved around the beginning of the
          <strong>holiday shopping season</strong> and what it tells us about the
          strength of the U.S. consumer.</p>

        <h3>1.1 Retail sales and holiday season</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Retail sales rose around 0.2% month-on-month</strong> and by more than
            4% year-on-year, signalling that households are still willing to spend
            despite tighter financial conditions.</li>
          <li>Early numbers from the Thanksgiving–Cyber Monday period showed
            <strong>record participation from shoppers</strong>, with both in-store and
            online channels performing strongly.</li>
          <li>Projections for total U.S. holiday sales pointed to a new high in nominal
            terms, supported by a combination of volume and still-elevated prices.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From a corporate finance angle, this is positive for revenue projections in
          sectors like discretionary retail, e-commerce, logistics, and payments.
          It also supports short-term earnings resilience for consumer-facing businesses.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Consumer confidence</h3>
        <p>Paradoxically, while spending activity was strong, <strong>survey measures
          of consumer confidence fell noticeably</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Confidence indices dropped well below their long-term averages.</li>
          <li>Households reported concern about inflation, income prospects,
            and the broader economic outlook.</li>
          <li>The “expectations” component (how people see the next 6–12 months)
            was particularly weak.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This disconnect between what consumers <em>say</em> and what they
          <em>do</em> is crucial for modelling. In the short run, spending can
          remain strong even when people feel pessimistic, especially if they have
          accumulated savings or access to credit. Over a longer horizon, however,
          sustained low confidence often leads to slower consumption growth.</p>

        <h2>2. Monetary Policy &amp; Inflation Expectations</h2>

        <p>Although there was no Federal Reserve meeting this week, markets
          continued to refine expectations for the <strong>December decision</strong>
          and for 2026.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Policy expectations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Investors still expected at least one more rate cut within the next
            few meetings, but the probability assigned to an immediate December
            move remained subject to incoming data.</li>
          <li>Disinflation progress earlier in the year supported the narrative
            that the <strong>policy stance is gradually shifting from restrictive
            toward neutral</strong>.</li>
          <li>However, stronger-than-expected consumer spending kept alive the
            possibility that inflation might prove stickier than headline numbers suggest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For valuation, the key point is that discount rate assumptions are
          not moving dramatically week to week, but small shifts in the expected
          path of policy still influence growth vs value, long vs short duration,
          and cross-asset preferences.</p>

        <h2>3. Equities: Stability Near Highs, Rotation Underneath</h2>

        <p>Equity indices were relatively calm, especially compared with earlier
          weeks marked by political risk and labour-market surprises.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Index-level performance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Major U.S. indices</strong> held near recent highs, with
            small weekly gains or flat performance depending on the benchmark.</li>
          <li>There were no extreme moves similar to previous weeks’ shocks
            (e.g. shutdown, crypto slump), which helped volatility stay contained.</li>
          <li>Global indices reflected a similar pattern: modest moves at the
            aggregate level, with more action at sector level.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Sector behaviour</h3>
        <p>Beneath the stable surface, there were still interesting rotations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consumer-related sectors</strong> (retail, e-commerce, payments)
            benefited from strong holiday sales data and upbeat revenue expectations.</li>
          <li><strong>Defensive sectors</strong> remained supported by investors who do
            not fully trust the soft-landing narrative and still want earnings stability.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate-sensitive growth names</strong> in tech and communication
            services moved mostly in line with small changes in yields and expectations
            about future policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For students, the key point is that equity markets were
          <strong>not in a risk-off mode</strong>, but neither were they euphoric.
          The balance between cyclical exposure and defensives suggests a
          “wait-and-see” stance, consistent with mixed macro signals.</p>

        <h2>4. Fixed Income: Yields, Curves, and the Message from Bonds</h2>

        <p>In fixed income, the week’s message can be summarised as modest
          adjustment rather than regime change.</p>

        <h3>4.1 Yield movements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Short-term yields</strong> drifted in line with shifting
            probabilities of a December cut, but without large breaks.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term yields</strong> remained anchored by disinflation
            expectations and by the view that real growth is slowing but still positive.</li>
          <li>The <strong>yield curve</strong> remained inverted, but less extremely
            than at the peak of the tightening cycle earlier in the year.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This pattern is consistent with markets pricing a controlled transition
          from restrictive to more neutral monetary policy, not a sudden pivot
          to emergency easing.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Credit spreads</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Investment grade spreads</strong> remained tight, reflecting
            solid corporate balance sheets and strong demand for relatively safe yield.</li>
          <li><strong>High yield spreads</strong> were stable to slightly wider,
            reflecting caution about weaker credits in a slower-growth environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In modelling cost of capital (WACC) or credit risk, this week
          reinforces the idea that <strong>credit conditions are not benign but
          also not stressed</strong>. Funding is available, but investors are
          selective and sensitive to leverage and cash-flow visibility.</p>

        <h2>5. FX &amp; Cross-Border Dynamics</h2>

        <p>Foreign exchange markets responded to a combination of changes in
          risk appetite and relative growth expectations.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>U.S. dollar</strong> traded in a tight range overall,
            balancing lower longer-term yields with still-attractive carry
            relative to some peers.</li>
          <li>Currencies of economies with stronger growth momentum or higher
            real yields attracted flows from investors seeking diversification.</li>
          <li>For export-oriented markets, exchange-rate moves continued to be
            a key driver of equity performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For finance students, FX is a reminder that any DCF or valuation of
          multinational firms must be consistent with assumptions about currency
          levels and volatility.</p>

        <h2>6. Commodities &amp; Alternatives: Demand Signals and Hedging</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Commodities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Oil prices</strong> reflected a tug of war between strong
            near-term demand (holiday travel, logistics) and concerns about
            softer global growth in 2026.</li>
          <li><strong>Gold</strong> remained elevated as a hedge against both
            macro and policy uncertainty, though without the explosive moves
            seen earlier in the year.</li>
          <li>Industrial metals continued to price expectations for global
            manufacturing and Chinese demand.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.2 Cryptoassets</h3>
        <p>Crypto markets showed more muted price action compared with the
          sharp declines of late November. Volatility remained high in relative
          terms, but the week was more about consolidation than about a new leg
          lower or higher.</p>

        <p>From a cross-asset perspective, this suggested that the immediate
          shock phase had passed, even if broader risk appetite was still fragile
          in more speculative corners of the market.</p>

        <h2>7. Interpreting the Week: What It Means for Models and Cases</h2>

        <p>Putting together macro, markets, and sentiment, the week of
          1–7 December 2025 supports a version of the
          <strong>soft-landing story</strong>, but with important caveats. For
          finance students, several points are especially useful:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Behaviour vs sentiment:</strong> when consumers keep spending
            despite weak confidence, short-term earnings may look fine, but you
            should be cautious in extrapolating current consumption growth too far
            into the future.</li>

          <li><strong>Top-down consistency:</strong> your revenue assumptions for
            retail, travel, and services should be consistent with both macro
            data (sales, income) and with what you assume about future rates and
            inflation.</li>

          <li><strong>Cross-asset checks:</strong> if equity markets price a
            soft landing, but credit spreads or yields tell a different story,
            you need to decide which signal you trust more in your analysis.</li>

          <li><strong>Short vs long horizon:</strong> in the short term, markets
            can be fully supported by strong holiday spending. Over a multi-year
            horizon, the sustainability of consumption depends on real income,
            employment, and debt dynamics.</li>

          <li><strong>Volatility regime:</strong> the relatively calm behaviour
            of major indices this week does not eliminate prior risks; it just
            suggests that, for now, markets are comfortable with the balance
            between growth and inflation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In summary, 1–7 December 2025 shows a market that is
          <strong>cautiously optimistic</strong>: macro data are good enough to
          support earnings, inflation is not re-accelerating, and policy is
          gradually shifting in a more supportive direction. At the same time,
          the gap between what people feel and what they do reminds us that the
          current equilibrium is not guaranteed to last.</p>
